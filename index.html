    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in IT from Ramrao Adik Institute of Technology. To gain experience in this field I did a 6-month long internship at Intelegain Technologies. I also actively assist in my Family Businesses which focus on waste paper management and Metal fabrication. From these opportunities, I not only learned skills like Digital Marketing and Graphic designing but I believe also the most valuable outcome which remains common is building and maintaining clientele.<br> 
Am an avid trekker as well and my love for adventure is not limited to it. I also like to spend my time bouldering and exploring various mountain ranges in India. In 2018 I Co-Founded a venture which carries out trekking in the Sahyadri. Something I intend to continue along with my work as an IT Engineer
